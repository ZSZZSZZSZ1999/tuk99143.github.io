                    <h2>Repeat On E</h2>
                    <p>This piece was written in fall of 2021 and it’s originated from a joke between me and my friends, they are all fantastic string players and one day they told me why you composers always write very complicate , harsh melody? So that i decided to write a piece with only one pitch at the beginning and then develop it.</p>

                    <h2>Cry in the Wind</h2>
                    <p>This piece was finished in the spring of 2022
                         and in order to attend SaxandvillaS international composition competition. At that time i was very fascinated with approaching
                         multiphonics on wind instrument and i think that technique can create
                         a timbre, a sound which is very malleable and astonishing, and then this piece was created and has been reading by some of
                         my friends. The multiphonics on wind blend very well with the piano</p>

                    <h2>Mediation At Midnight</h2>
                    <p>Meditation at Midnight was composed last summer and
                         represents the time when I try to quiet down and clear my mind at night before I start to work. The whole piece is basically divided into three stages: trying to get into meditation, being influenced by thought, and finally finding peace. All the small elements in this piece are in flux.</p>
